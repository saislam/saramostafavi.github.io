  abstract: >
    To extend our understanding of the genetic basis of human immune
    function and dysfunction, we performed an expression quantitative
    trait locus (eQTL) study of purified CD4(+) T cells and monocytes,
    representing adaptive and innate immunity, in a multi-ethnic
    cohort of 461 healthy individuals. Context-specific cis- and
    trans-eQTLs were identified, and cross-population mapping allowed,
    in some cases, putative functional assignment of candidate causal
    regulatory variants for disease-associated loci. We note an
    over-representation of T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility
    alleles for autoimmune diseases and of monocyte-specific eQTLs
    among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease variants. This
    polarization implicates specific immune cell types in these
    diseases and points to the need to identify the cell-autonomous
    effects of disease susceptibility variants.
