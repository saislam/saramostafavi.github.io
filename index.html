<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>We develop and apply machine learning and statistical methods to study the genomics of complex diseases, with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders. We are especially interested in developing models for combining association evidence across multiple types of genomic data, such as gene expression and genotype data, and modeling prior biological pathways and networks for disentangling spurious from meaningful correlations.

<p>About Sara Mostafavi:</p>
  
<p>
Sara Mostafavi Assistant Professor (as of January 2015), at the Department of Statistics & the Department of Medical Genetics, and an affiliate member of the Department of Computer Science, at University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada.
She is a Canada Research Chair (<a href="http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3457">CRC II</a>) in Computational Biology. 

Before then, I was a postdoc at Stanford, working with Daphne Koller. 

I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2011, where I worked with Quaid Morris. 
My thesis was on integrating large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets to predict gene function,
