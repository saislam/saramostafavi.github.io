<h1>Welcome!</h1> 

<p>Our lab is interested in developing and using machine learning and statistical techniques to study and understand the genetic basis of complex diseases, with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders. We are especially interested in developing models for combining association evidence across multiple types of genomic data, such as gene expression and genotype data, and modeling prior biological pathways and networks for disentangling spurious from meaningful correlations.</p>

Before then, I was a postdoc at Stanford, working with Daphne Koller. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2011, where I worked with Quaid Morris. My thesis was on integrating large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets to predict gene function, check out GeneMANIA to find out more! You can find my CV here and my google scholar page here.
