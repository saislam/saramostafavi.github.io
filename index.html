<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>We develop and apply machine learning and statistical methods to study the genomics of complex diseases, with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders. We are especially interested in developing models for combining association evidence across multiple types of genomic data, such as gene expression and genotype data, and modeling prior biological pathways and networks for disentangling spurious from meaningful correlations.</p>

  <h4>About Sara Mostafavi:</h4>
  
   <p>I arrived at UBC in January 2015, after a stop at the Benoist & Mathis lab at Harvard medical school in 2014. Before then, I was a postdoc at Stanford, working with Daphne Koller. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2011, where I worked with Quaid Morris. My thesis was on integrating large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets to predict gene function, check out GeneMANIA to find out more! You can find my CV here and my google scholar page here.</p>
