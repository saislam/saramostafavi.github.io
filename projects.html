        <h3 class="heading">Modeling the impact of genetic variation on multiple types of cellular traits</h3>
        <div class="content">
            We are developing integrative computational approaches for predicting the impact of genetic variation 
            on multiple types of cellular traits, including DNA methylation, histone modification,and gene expression.

        <div class="content">
            We are developing machine learning methods for modeling the effect of hidden and "partially" confounding factors in gene expression and methylation data. 
            Within this direction, we are also interested in estimating cell type proportions in under-studied mixed tissues such as brain and cord blood.

        <div class="content">
            Working with clinical colleagues at UBC and elsewhere, we are developing association analysis approaches using multiple types of omics data. 
            Specifically, we are currently focusing on integrative analysis of genotype, gene expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification
            data in order to identify genes and networks that are associated with neurodegeneration and cognifive function.

        <div class="content">
            We have developed machine learning approaches for constructing gene functional association and gene regulatory networks in a context- and tissue-specific manner.
