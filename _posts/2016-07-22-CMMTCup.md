  The Mostafavi and Wasserman labs teamed up to challenge the Hayden lab to a game of Archery Tag for the CMMT Cup. The competition was fierce, but after 1.5hours of battle, the Mostafavi/Wasserman team won the cup. Thanks to all members who played and cheered, the cup will reside in the Bioinformatics lab for now!
